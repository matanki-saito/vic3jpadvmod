 negotiation.1.f2: "I walked around the square several times before approaching the stall. I spoke the key phrase: "These are fine lamps." Two men closed on either side of me. In all my years of service my heart has never thumped such a desperate waltz. Certain I was undone, I fell limp in their arms and was carried through the crowd to their negotiator.

 negotiation.1.d5: "Whispering through a haze of cigar smoke in [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('ig').GetLeader.GetFullName]'s private dining hall, the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('ig').GetName] discuss what compromises they might accept for changing their stance on [SCOPE.sLaw('law').GetName]."

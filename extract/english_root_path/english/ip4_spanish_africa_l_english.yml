 je_conquest_of_tetouan: "Eye for an Eye"
 je_conquest_of_tetouan_reason: "The last straw to break the camel's back has been pulled by the Anjeran tribesmen local to the [SelectLocalization(SCOPE.sState('al_rif').IsValid, SCOPE.sState('al_rif').GetName, 'STATE_AL_RIF')] region. They recently carried out a bloody raid on one of our border garrisons.\n\nThe [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('armed_forces_scope').GetName] and local subjects of the region demand retribution against these marauders beyond the border to [SelectLocalization(SCOPE.sCountry('morocco_scope').IsValid, SCOPE.sCountry('morocco_scope').GetName, 'MOR')].\n\nOur national stature will significantly deteriorate if military measures aren't taken promptly."
 je_western_saharan_conquest: "A Saharan Twilight"
 je_western_saharan_conquest_reason: "After the victory in [SCOPE.sStateRegion('al_rif_scope').GetName], a strategic location beyond the horizon has been identified by the experienced generals of the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('armed_forces_scope').GetName]. Along with its natural resources, this part of Africa will surely aid us in our mission to reclaim the prestige we once possessed."
 je_guinean_conquest: "Equatorial Foothold"
 je_guinean_conquest_reason: "Reinforcing the coastal security of Western Africa and its isolated areas has rekindled our ambition to reclaim our imperial status as a significant power on the continent.\n\nWe need to push forward and expand our influence along the coasts of [GetGeographicRegion('geographic_region_subsaharan_africa').GetName], as our imperial competitors are also eager to profit from the region's riches."
 je_moroccan_conquest: "Maghreb's Garden"
 je_moroccan_conquest_reason: "Given the success of our recent initiatives in Africa, officials agree that our efforts would be truly fulfilled by acquiring the territories beyond the [SCOPE.sStateRegion('gibraltar_scope').GetName].\n\nThey also warn us that it would present a new challenge to subdue its inhabitants under our rule, even after conquering the official lands, considering the numerous tribal communities separated from central politics. Nevertheless, we'll turn this part of the Maghreb into our backyard beyond Andalusia by accomplishing this task."

 je_guinean_conquest_complete_tt: "At least #v 3#! [Concept('concept_state', '$concept_states$')] in [GetGeographicRegion('geographic_region_subsaharan_africa').GetName] are owned by [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] or any of her #v $colonial$#! [Concept('concept_subject', '$concept_subjects$')]"

 revoke_fernando_po_tt: "Sends a formal demand for #v $GBR$#! to revoke their lease on the island of #b Fernando Po#!. If they accept, we will take control of the island immediately.

 # Events
 #1 Initiation for Al Rif
 spanish_africa.1.t: "Border Harassments"
 spanish_africa.1.d: "Tribesmen of [SCOPE.sState('al_rif_state_scope').GetName] has been relentlessly raiding our side of the border, harassing travellers and caravans. Their assault on a military garrison was the final straw. The [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('armed_forces_scope').GetName] insist that this is the perfect moment to take long-awaited action against [SCOPE.sCountry('rif_enemy_scope').GetName]."
 spanish_africa.1.f: "Overlooking the encampment in his saddle, Chief Rashan assessed dim prospects while dusk nearly concealed their presence on this side of the hill.\n\n"Rumors are true, my Chief, Uqban is martyred, possibly with his mare. Do we try once more tomorrow?"\n\n"May he rest easy in al-Barzakh." He paused briefly before turning his steed to face the scout. "We return at dawn, after fajr prayer. This is not the night.""
 spanish_africa.1.a: "Let us demonstrate who we are."
 spanish_africa.1.a_tt: "The [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('armed_forces_scope').GetName] and their supporters will expect us or one of our subjects to own [SCOPE.sStateRegion('al_rif_scope').GetName] within 10 years. Failing to achieve this will reduce our [concept_legitimacy] and their [concept_approval], and foster [Concept('concept_radical','$concept_radicals$')] within their ranks. Conversely, succeeding will put us on better terms with them and boost our [concept_prestige]."
 spanish_africa.1.b: "We must not kindle the fire."

 #2 Al Rif conquered, now Western Sahara
 spanish_africa.2.t: "Retribution"
 spanish_africa.2.d: "Subduing [SCOPE.sStateRegion('al_rif_scope').GetName] and ensuring our dominance over the northern coast has reassured our people. However, the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('armed_forces_scope').GetName] seek further glory. They urge us to shift our focus southward, toward the wild expanse of [SCOPE.sState('west_sahara_state_scope').GetName]."
 spanish_africa.2.f: "Vendors and workshops in Tetouan, run by local families for generations, felt a collective uneasiness about the future of their businesses. Even before the Spaniards' official arrival, bazaars were affected by the idea of the industrious juggernauts hailing from northern countries with their mass-produced goods.\n\nThey quickly realized that endlessly increasing taxes issued by the Makhzen or inflating local economies should've been the least of their concerns, compared to what might await them under the 'protection' of the Andalusians."
 spanish_africa.2.a: "No point in stopping now, let us keep the momentum."
 spanish_africa.2.a_tt: "The [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('armed_forces_scope').GetName] and their supporters will expect us or one of our subjects to own [SCOPE.sStateRegion('west_sahara_scope').GetName] within 10 years. Failing to achieve this will reduce our [concept_legitimacy] and their [concept_approval], and foster [Concept('concept_radical','$concept_radicals$')] within their ranks. Conversely, succeeding will put us on better terms with them and boost our [concept_prestige]."
 spanish_africa.2.b: "We should rather settle and focus on our internal struggles."

 #3 Western Sahara conquered, now Guinea
 spanish_africa.3.t: "Into the Heart of Africa"
 spanish_africa.3.d: "With [SCOPE.sState('west_sahara_scope').GetName] brought under our rule, we have obtained a new foothold that can be utilized to connect the mainland to the core of Africa. The [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('armed_forces_scope').GetName] urge us to keep up our present momentum by expanding our presence South of the Sahara."
 spanish_africa.3.f: "Accustomed to nomadic traditions, some clans could not envision living under the rule of infidels and began their hijra toward the vast ocean that is the Sahara.\n\nAmong them was Banu Khezzan, a small group of families with herds to protect. Unaware of the political complexities of recent events, Saleeh, a young member of the clan, felt something difficult to articulate in his small mind.\n\nSomething that reeked of vengeance and fury toward those who had forced him to move once again."
 spanish_africa.3.a: "Begin preparations, now!"
 spanish_africa.3.a_tt: "The [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('armed_forces_scope').GetName] and their supporters will expect us to have at least 3 [Concept('concept_colony','$concept_colonies$')] in [GetGeographicRegion('geographic_region_subsaharan_africa').GetName] within 10 years. Failing to achieve this will reduce our [concept_legitimacy] and their [concept_approval], and foster [Concept('concept_radical','$concept_radicals$')] within their ranks. Conversely, succeeding will put us on better terms with them and boost our [concept_prestige]."
 spanish_africa.3.b: "We must not stray too far from our homelands."

 #4 Guinea conquered, now Morocco
 spanish_africa.4.t: "Tying Loose Ends"
 spanish_africa.4.d: "Emboldened by the success of our recent forays into Africa, the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('armed_forces_scope').GetName] suggest maneuvering our now-experienced soldiers to seize control of what is between the mainland and [SCOPE.sState('west_sahara_scope').GetName]."
 spanish_africa.4.f: ""How about the chapel?", asked the governor, pointing towards the center of the plan on the table beneath the makeshift tent.\n\n"How about it, Gobernador?", replied the puzzled architect, recalling the moment of him even explaining the casting of its bell.\n\n"Are we using stones or wood?" — the smell should've given it away. He was clearly still tipsy. \n\n"Stones, sir? Stones. From the homeland herself.""
 spanish_africa.4.a: "It makes perfect sense."
 spanish_africa.4.a_tt: "The [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('armed_forces_scope').GetName] and their supporters will expect us to make [SCOPE.sCountry('morocco_scope').GetName] our [concept_subject] or own the following [Concept('concept_state_region','$concept_state_regions$')] within 10 years:\n• [SCOPE.sStateRegion('al_rif_scope').GetName]\n• [SCOPE.sStateRegion('fez_scope').GetName]\n• [SCOPE.sStateRegion('inner_morocco_scope').GetName]\n• [SCOPE.sStateRegion('marrakech_scope').GetName]\nFailing to achieve this will reduce our [concept_legitimacy] and their [concept_approval], and foster [Concept('concept_radical','$concept_radicals$')] within their ranks. Conversely, succeeding will put us on better terms with them and boost our [concept_prestige]."
 spanish_africa.4.b: "We should not act on the whims of soldiers."

 #5 Gibraltar owned completely, "The Pillars of Hercules"
 spanish_africa.5.t: "The Pillars of Hercules"
 spanish_africa.5.d:1 "At long last, we have taken the Rock of Gibraltar back from the $GBR_ADJ$, restoring the [SCOPE.sStateRegion('gibraltar_scope').GetName] as an integral part of our dominions. The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] has declared a new national holiday to celebrate the reconquest."
 spanish_africa.5.f: "#italic Plus Ultra#! — With this motto, the Spanish Empire had always aspired to an unimaginable journey across all coasts beyond its peninsular homelands.\n\n#italic Further Beyond#! — In the esteemed Latin tongue, its meaning signifies our duty as a nation to uphold the gates of wonder and courage for those who wish to take risks and strive for excellence beyond the Mediterranean.\n\nOnce again, we are the rightful guardians of the East and West."
 spanish_africa.5.a: "Hercules would be proud."

 #6 revoke_fernando_po decision: Revoke request for the lease of Fernando Po
 spanish_africa.6.t: "Lease of [SCOPE.sState('fernando_po_scope').GetName]"
 spanish_africa.6.d: "An envoy from [SCOPE.sCountry('spain_scope').GetName] has been awaiting our diplomatic response regarding a request to surrender [SCOPE.sState('fernando_po_scope').GetName], asserting their claim as the rightful owners of the island."
 spanish_africa.6.f: "Even as an experienced one, the diplomat from [SCOPE.sCountry('spain_scope').GetNameNoFormatting]'s arrival in [SCOPE.sState('gbr_capital_scope').GetNameNoFormatting] for the first time was an unforgettable memory. From bustling boulevards to neatly walled parks and intricately built bridges, there was something awe-inspiring about this place, unlike any other, he thought.\n\nUnfortunately, it was not the time to linger, as the appointment was set for the same day.\n\nThe message was clear; and his [SCOPE.sCountry('spain_scope').GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] would hardly accept a refusal for an answer."
 spanish_africa.6.a: "They have the right, evacuate the island."
 spanish_africa.6.a_tt: "We will let [SCOPE.sCountry('spain_scope').GetName] know that the lease is revoked."
 spanish_africa.6.b: "Never!"
 spanish_africa.6.b_tt: "[SCOPE.sCountry('spain_scope').GetName] will soon receive the news of our refusal."

 spanish_africa.7.f: ""Where are we going mamá?"\n\n"To Fernando Pó, cielo."\n\n"Will we be happy there?"\n\n"Of course we will, they say it's a beautiful island."\n\n"But we are already happy here? And, why is papá not coming with us?"\n\n"We do as our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] says, cariño. Everything will be fine. You don't need to worry.""
 spanish_africa.7.a: "Excellent."

 #8 revoke_fernando_po decision: Britain rejects
 spanish_africa.8.t: "[SCOPE.sCountry('gbr_scope').GetName] Occupies [SCOPE.sState('fernando_po_scope').GetName]"
 spanish_africa.8.d: "[SCOPE.sCountry('gbr_scope').GetName] has rejected our request to revoke the lease of [SCOPE.sState('fernando_po_scope').GetName]."
 spanish_africa.8.f: "#bold Agnign#! — an expression the indigenous people of [SCOPE.sState('fernando_po_scope').GetNameNoFormatting] uses, roughly translates to the European tongues as "to live," or "to experience".\n\nOnce they #italic lived#!, unaware of civilized people's intentions of their sacred soil.\n\nAnd they #italic experienced#! freely, cherishing every moment unfettered from foreign distractions."

 spanish_africa.10.t: "An African Blunder"
 spanish_africa.10.d: "Failing to achieve our expansionist prospects in Africa have made the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('armed_forces_scope').GetName] and its supporters intensely agitated."
 spanish_africa.10.f: ""Gentlemen, a nation that does not expand dies a slow and painful death. I am sure you all agree with me on this. We must secure our destiny by force if need be.  What they call our ambition as "recklessness," we call vision and a justified thirst for glory that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetNameNoFormatting] has deserved for a long time. Today is not that day, but let me tell you, it is nigh."\n\nSeasoned officers nodded to each other, digesting the words. One could almost believe they would not shoot one another in the back for a promotion."
 spanish_africa.10.a: "They should know their places."
 spanish_africa.10.b: "Perhaps there is a compromise?"

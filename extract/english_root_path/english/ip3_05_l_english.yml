 serbia.1.f:1 ""Indubitably, my [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] our support is to you. As we were bound by your hallowed speech under the oak tree for revolution, we shall stand by you once again for the glory of Serbia."\n\nBootlicker as he was, his confidence was effortless. The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] wondered how he could manage it. His unreliable nature had been public information for some time, now - it seemed that he was the only person in the room who believed in his own credibility."
 serbia.1.a: "The price of loyalty is everchanging."

 serbia.2.f:1 ""...and our struggle extends beyond worldly matters, as we hold in our hands the divine right to rule and not be ruled." The new prince glanced over to gauge reactions.

 serbia.2.a: "May his reign be memorable."

 serbian_throne.1.f: "In a quiet valley of the village of Takovo, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullNameNoFormatting] and his fellow folk walked out of the congregation, as he declared a Serbian uprising against the Ottomans.\n\nThe year was 1815. Those who named themselves "heroes" have already fled to find shelter under the wings of their foreign masters. One of them was Karađorđe, [SCOPE.sCharacter('rival_dynasty_contender_scope').GetFirstNameNoFormatting]'s father."
 serbian_throne.1.a: "This should be sufficient."

 serbian_throne.2.f:1 "There is a fine line between propaganda and slander. And for sure, the former has the potential to be a politician's deadliest weapon. A pamphlet sample made by a renowned artist and calligrapher was presented to the Prince that morning.\n\nHolding the paper, he observed that under many mischievous 'facts' written on top, there was the patriarch of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCustom('serbia_rival_dynasty')] on all fours, chewing on thigh meat that was captioned as 'a Serbian Peasant' in the local tongue while being ridiculed and commanded by an Ottoman pasha."

 serbian_throne.3.f: "Banquets serve as important gatherings where various unspoken dynamics unfold. They often involve negotiations, displays of influence, slurping sounds of gluttonous megalomaniacs, and the ever-present competition to maintain prestige among peers. \n\nNavigating the complexities of individuals who present different facets of themselves is both a challenging and rewarding endeavor."

 serbian_throne.4.f: ""You know how they are, my [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle]. They used to enjoy raiding Ottoman trade caravans and aristocrats, but all they have left now are peasants without anyone to protect them." the advisor shooed the messenger with a swift gesture before proceeding "Karađorđe was one of them during the years of rebellion, now his son is trying to keep his father's friends happy.""

 serbian_throne.5.f: "Empathy is an attribute all remarkable leaders must possess. Having rebelled against undesired oppression, the Prince knows very well the meaning of taking back what's actually yours.\n\n"Nothing short of a group of young, gullible rascals they are." he murmured while peeking out the window.

 serbian_throne.5.c: "No need for bloodshed, everyone has a price."

 #6 RE
 serbian_throne.6.t: "Plea for Aid"
 serbian_throne.6.d: "Dire news of Magyarization in [SCOPE.sState('delvidek_scope').GetName] has reached us recently. Certain Serbian villages await support from their brethren over the river. This is a valuable opportunity to bolster our stance against [SCOPE.sCharacter('rival_dynasty_contender_scope').GetFullName]."
 serbian_throne.6.f: "The aidant untied a string that tightened all envelopes together, before opening the top-most one to read aloud.\n\n"To his Most Excellent Majesty, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstNameNoFormatting] of House [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetLastNameNoFormatting], [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] of all honorable Serbs.\n\nMay it please your greatness,\n\nI am writing humbly on behalf of our unworthy, but loyal village to ask for a return of favor.

 serbian_throne.9.f:1 ""Is this how you treat your saviors?" panic and desperation echoed throughout the hall "My father led this country to freedom while you were all hoarding riches.

 serbian_throne.10.f: ""Comrades! Sacred mothers! We are now free from the grasp of nesting politicians who do nothing for the sake of our homeland..." exclaimed the new [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetNameNoFormatting]. \n\nRecalling his father's heroic pursuit of freedom, the crowd kept on cheering, eager to heed the final judgment. \n\n"...and what say you for the fate of betrayers?" the Prince paused briefly, confident that whatever next came out of his mouth, they would comply without question."

 serbian_throne.11.f: ""It is unwise to divide a realm for the sake of transient discords of families. That is why solidarity is the essence of progress as distractions have always been known to lead men astray from the straight path.\n\nBesides, infighting ordinarily causes suffering to those whose only responsibility is to pay taxes. \n\nGentlemen, we have a nation to build!""
 serbian_throne.11.a: "Long live Serbia!"

 # Campaign fund planning event
 serbian_throne.12.t: "Campaign Planning"

  ottoman_monarchs.1.f: "Early morning recitations of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstNameNoFormatting] were abruptly interrupted by the sound of cülûs cannons. He anticipated what would happen next as the Eunuch barged into the room to deliver the unfortunate news.\n\nThe palace was surrounded by those who had saluted his commands the day before, and a boat was prepared for a journey into seclusion. Officers were already beginning to ascend the stairs to escort him."
  ottoman_monarchs.1.a: "Vallahi, this is the work of kâfirs..."
  ottoman_monarchs.1_tt: "A successful coup has dethroned [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] with a new [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle]."

  # Murad Lunacy event

  ottoman_monarchs.2.d: "Members of Bâb-ı Âli have decided that a new ruler must rise to rule our nation due to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName]'s lack of sanity."
  ottoman_monarchs.2.f: "After episodes of public acts of shame to his name, the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] was found shaking in the bed with fear and paranoia.\n\nThe reported murder of former Sultan Abdulaziz after his dethronement worsened the mental state of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstNameNoFormatting].\n\nAttempts to jump into the palace pool and flee from clergymen during the allegiance ceremony undoubtedly showed that his reign would be short."
  ottoman_monarchs.2.a: "Get away from me!"
  ottoman_monarchs.2_tt: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] is receiving mental health care, while the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] next in line is being prepared to take over the leadership."

 dlc003_desc: "The age of industrialization is the age of transformation, when millions of pastoral workers relocated to factories. This 14-track, nearly hour long collection of original music is a concert honoring the daily struggles and ambitions of the common people, inspired by the romantic yearnings for those simpler days of working on the land. "
 dlc004_desc: "The people march with bouquets in one hand and blazing torches in the other with the Voice of the People immersion pack. As the gears of progress turn onward, new champions emerge to spearhead fresh modes of thought. And while these forces clash around the globe, France finds itself wracked with tumult from changing dynasties, claims on North Africa and on mainland Europe, and an affair that has become a battle for the nation’s soul. Allons-y!"
 dlc007_desc: "From the glory of the sunrise to the glow of the gas lamp, this Art Pack takes the theme of light and shadow to add new life to the visual experience. A day-night cycle marks the time you spend in game, and other images shine with new life as the dawn of a new age is reflected in the art itself."
 dlc008_desc: "A new dawn rises over South America, and with this Region Pack comes the winds of change. In Brazil, a boy of age is put upon the throne abandoned by his father. Amidst the schemes of a new aristocracy finding its footing in coffee and milk, a church of science rises, and cangaceiros tear through the countryside. And in the ashes of Bolivar's ambitions, Paraguay ends its splendid isolation to take its place on the world's stage. A time of strife and hope will put Brazil to the anvil: what it becomes is up to you."

 dlc003_desc: "The age of industrialization is the age of transformation, when millions of pastoral workers relocated to factories. This 14-track, nearly hour long collection of original music is a concert honoring the daily struggles and ambitions of the common people, inspired by the romantic yearnings for those simpler days of working on the land. "
 dlc004_desc: "The people march with bouquets in one hand and blazing torches in the other with the Voice of the People immersion pack. As the gears of progress turn onward, new champions emerge to spearhead fresh modes of thought. And while these forces clash around the globe, France finds itself wracked with tumult from changing dynasties, claims on North Africa and on mainland Europe, and an affair that has become a battle for the nation’s soul. Allons-y!"
 dlc007_desc: "From the glory of the sunrise to the glow of the gas lamp, this Art Pack takes the theme of light and shadow to add new life to the visual experience. A day-night cycle marks the time you spend in game, and other images shine with new life as the dawn of a new age is reflected in the art itself."
 dlc008_desc: "A new dawn rises over South America, and with this Region Pack comes the winds of change. In Brazil, a boy of age is put upon the throne abandoned by his father. Amidst the schemes of a new aristocracy finding its footing in coffee and milk, a church of science rises, and cangaceiros tear through the countryside. And in the ashes of Bolivar's ambitions, Paraguay ends its splendid isolation to take its place on the world's stage. A time of strife and hope will put Brazil to the anvil: what it becomes is up to you."
 dlc010_desc: "From the forests of the Caucasus to the mountains of Korea, the great empires of the Victorian age struggle against one another for diplomatic supremacy. Diplomats and common citizens alike lobby governments to project power outside of their borders, and strive to prevent their opponents from doing the same. Great Powers stand at the heads of mighty power blocs, using their subordinates to advance their interests. Influence, invest, and subjugate your way into expanding your own Sphere of Influence—for in the great game of international politics, there are only players and pawns."
 dlc011_desc: "The slow advance of the East India Company has brought the Indian subcontinent under its dominion, reducing the rule of the Mughal and Maratha emperors to their palace grounds. In this new, colonial India, the forces of British bureaucratic despotism clash with threats both internal and external - discontent soldiers, rising Indian nationalism, and the upstart Sikh Empire. Struggle against colonial domination at the side of a multitude of Indian freedom fighters, or stand with the British administration's efforts to maintain power over this Pivot of Empire—lest its sun finally set."
 dlc012_desc: "Watch the benefits of trade roll into port with the Trade Ships Bonus Pack, an art pack immediately available for free to everyone who buys the Victoria 3: Expansion Pass. This pack includes three new ship designs for the on-map representation of commercial vessels crossing the trade lanes of the globe."
 dlc013_desc: "The chatter of ticker-tape machines and the whistling of steamships mark the age of the global market. Companies and countries alike vie for prestige and market share on the world stage, with monopolies, warships, and unequal treaties as their weapons of choice. Secure a cultural edge with unique prestige goods, grant special charters to companies, and manipulate foreign nations with special diplomatic options. Buy, sell, and leverage your way to supremacy—for on the world market, there is no good will, only good business."
 dlc014_desc: "The Age of Progress has come to the Balkan region, and with it, its peoples' National Awakenings. In the sprawling Austrian Empire, the post-Napoleonic order of Metternich meets the challenges of modernity. Nationalists call for an independent Hungary, whilst ethnic federalists and neo-absolutists alike seek to realize their vision for a reformed Empire. The young nations of the Balkan region aspire to independence and greatness, seeking to forge peasants into citizens and claim their homelands from the ailing Ottomans. From the Danube to the Black Sea, two visions collide - will the people of the Balkans be subjects of an empire, or citizens of a nation?"
 dlc015_desc: "The Victorian century is the age of emerging national identity. Academics swept up by the spirit of the age transformed peasant ballads into symphonies, which become striking symbols of their young nations. This collection of original music, recorded by a live symphony and chamber orchestra and inspired by the romantic spirit of the age, captures the pride of nations finding a new place in the world."
 dlc016_desc: "Long gone is the golden age of Iberia. Still reeling from the loss of their colonies on the American mainland in the wake of the Napoleonic Wars, the old colonial giants of Spain and Portugal seek new paths to greatness as the forces of reform and reaction tirelessly war over the soul of the nation. And in the colonial periphery, subjects are roused as new ideas and innovations are disseminated among them."

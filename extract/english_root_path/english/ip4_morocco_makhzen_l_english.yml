# Events
#1 Initial Event
 lands_of_anarchy.1.t: "Lands of Anarchy"
 lands_of_anarchy.1.d: "Time-honored tribes around the corners of our nation have become increasingly difficult to control. If we don't demonstrate our authority, they might slip out of our grasp."
 lands_of_anarchy.1.f: ""...secondly, asking for that much mahr is somewhat untraditional and quite rude. My nephew is thinking about withdrawing if she insists.\n\n"Ayrad, my old friend, since when do you judge our marriage contracts by the customs of urban people? At my age, I have yet to hear a shaykh lecture fiqh about limits on a bride's demands from the groom."\n\nSeeing the failure of his attempt, Elder Ayrad reconsidered his options."
 lands_of_anarchy.1.a: "They shall face the might of Makhzen."

#2 Complete Event

 lands_of_anarchy.2.d: "All lawless tribes have surrendered to our authority, willingly or not. Our rule over the mainland remains undisputed, allowing us to invest more in these lands."
 lands_of_anarchy.2.f: "The Makhzen is not the only beneficiary of recent changes in Moroccan society. Old hatreds and cultural gaps have mostly disappeared, giving way to new neighbors, shared traditions, and experts in all fields, contributing with an innate disposition to urban life.\n\nThose who refused to be a part of the central crowd and stayed rural have also found communal bliss through modern communication methods provided by the government. Merchants, tax collectors, and armed forces, among others, are safer to roam the lands to carry out their tasks."

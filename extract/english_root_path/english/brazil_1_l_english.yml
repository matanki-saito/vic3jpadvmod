  pedro.1.d: "The Triumviral Regency of the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('landowners_scope').GetName] and [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('armed_forces_scope').GetName] was recently overthrown and replaced by the democratically selected [SCOPE.sCharacter('feijo_regent').GetLastName] Regency. Until [SCOPE.sCharacter('pedro_scope').GetPrimaryRoleTitle] [SCOPE.sCharacter('pedro_scope').GetFirstName] comes of age, Brazil will likely be engulfed by political turmoil."
  pedro.1.f: "Chess, lauded as the game of kings for over a thousand years, stresses strategic acumen. Long strategies require sacrifice, cost calculation, and a keen sense of literacy. And as one player slips, another gains control of the board.\n\nBut the board of this game was the young emperor himself. Who knows what scars these intrigues would leave on a boy?"
  pedro.1.a: "Will they never cease their squabbling?"

  pedro.2.d: "The [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('landowners_scope').GetName] have suffered many grievances under the reign of [SCOPE.sCharacter('pedro_scope').GetPrimaryRoleTitle] [SCOPE.sCharacter('pedro_scope').GetFirstName]. Many now openly oppose the [GetLawType('law_monarchy').GetName] in favor of an [SCOPE.sIdeology('elitist_scope').GetName] [GetLawType('law_presidential_republic').GetName]."
  pedro.2.f: "Moments earlier, Senhor [SCOPE.sCharacter('landowner_leader').GetLastNameNoFormatting] waved away the carts that took away the last of his slaves. As the sun set and the cart trundled out of sight, he slammed the door shut. Seven generations on the plantation now ruined on his watch. It seemed that the Emperor's senses had finally failed.\n\nNow, with rum in one hand and a pen in the other, he wrote to his neighbors. Perhaps the other plantation owners likewise felt a change was in order."
  pedro.2.f2: "Moments before, writs and invoices were scattered over Senhor [SCOPE.sCharacter('landowner_leader').GetLastNameNoFormatting]'s sprawling desk. The imperial taxes were one thing, imports and exports another, and security for the coffee plantation were a third. All of them combined were breaking the estate. The Emperor would have no hand to help, only to take. [SCOPE.sCharacter('landowner_leader').GetFirstNameNoFormatting] was sure he wasn't the only one buckling under laws.\n\nNow, with rum in one hand and a pen in the other, he wrote to his neighbors. Perhaps the other plantation owners likewise felt a change was in order."
  pedro.2.a: "A worrying turn of events."
  pedro.3.t: "An Early Coronation"
  pedro.3.d: "Hoping to gain political capital, the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('coronation_ig').GetName] regency has decided to crown [SCOPE.sCharacter('pedro_scope').GetFullName] as [SCOPE.sCharacter('pedro_scope').GetPrimaryRoleTitle] of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] significantly earlier than planned."

  pedro.3.a: "So begins his reign."
  pedro.4.t: "The Emperor's Ill Health"
  pedro.4.d: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('pedro_scope').GetPrimaryRoleTitle] [SCOPE.sCharacter('pedro_scope').GetFullName] is no longer the young, healthy man he once was. His ability to perform his functions as monarch are in decline. Speculation and scheming surrounds the matter of succession and the future of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] government."
  pedro.4.f: "Entropy comes for all things, great and small. Whether by sword or decay, the Emperor of Brazil was destined to meet an end. Decades of delayed stress, forced action, and dynamic industry have finally damned him. Sickness would have its dues soon, and the vultures in his court would gladly feast on such a grand carcass."
  pedro.4.a: "No man lives forever."
  pedro.5.t: "Just a Setback"
  pedro.5.d: "The [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('marginal_ig_scope').GetName], once a great potential threat to the [GetLawType('law_monarchy').GetName] of [SCOPE.sCharacter('pedro_scope').GetPrimaryRoleTitle] [SCOPE.sCharacter('pedro_scope').GetFirstName], have become politically marginalized. This is surely a positive omen for the future stability of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] government."
  pedro.5.f: "Generals and admirals stood at attention behind their civilian ministers. The ministers themselves were less dignified than their counterparts. The directive came: ministries closed, offices diminished, and connections severed. Whatever power they wielded now was but a whisper amidst a storm.\n\nOf course, the military would rise again. A strong arm is needed in a dangerous world. For now, they were at Dom Pedro's side rather than his throat."
  pedro.5.f2: ""What is the meaning of this? I bought you all, housed you all, even freed you at great cost to my family. And this is how you repay me? By taking everything I haven't nailed down!"\n\n"Smile, Senhor. Order and progress have made it so we are both hard working men. Your coffee is of great value to everyone in Brazil. The Imperador offers his thanks, as well as remuneration."\n\n"Peanuts! I'm offered peanuts! I'll not be mocked this way. Mark my words, there will be recompense!""

  brz_new_monarch_popular: "Popular Monarch"
  pedro.6.t: "A Powerful Enemy"
  pedro.6.d: "The growing resentment of the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('powerful_ig_scope').GetName] is becoming difficult to ignore. These powerful elites wield great sway in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], and their lack of inclusion in government further turns them against [SCOPE.sCharacter('pedro_scope').GetFirstName]'s [GetLawType('law_monarchy').GetName]."
  pedro.6.f: "Generals wear finery, and ship officers flaunt lavish gifts beyond their stations. Enlisted troops speak so highly of the civilian ministers that one might question their true loyalties. Meanwhile, those same ministers begin overstepping their bounds. With the armed forces trained enough to look away, who would stop them from taking what they demand?"
  pedro.6.f2: ""My son, come. You are coming of age now, and one day I will be too old to work this estate. Look over this balcony and take in what you see. It is yours. The peons in the fields are yours. The coffee in this field and the cows in the next are also yours. The town, its people, and the very forests are yours. And I'm told your days at university are well spent. That ministerial seat you eye, if you work hard for it, will also be yours. And so it will also be for your son.""
  pedro.6.a: "This warrants careful attention."
  pedro.7.t: "Enduring Empire"
  pedro.7.d: "With the solemn passing of Emperor Pedro II, a week of mourning has bee declared across [ROOT.GetCountry.GetNameNoFormatting]. His reign will surely be remembered as one of the greatest periods of our nation's history. Plans must now begin for the coronation of [SCOPE.sCharacter('new_brz_monarch_scope').GetFullName], who the people look to with admiration and respect to lead them onwards."
  pedro.7.f: "Old tales once held that Heaven weeps when a great man dies. When Dom Pedro of Bragança died, there was scarcely a moment without rain. Tens of thousands lined his funeral procession, wearing black and flying Brazilian flags. Dignitaries from as far as Japan bore witness to the event, each laying forth their own tokens of respect.\n\nThe heavy crown that once harrowed [SCOPE.sCharacter('new_brz_monarch_scope').GetHerHis]'s father now loomed over [SCOPE.sCharacter('new_brz_monarch_scope').GetHerHis]. [SCOPE.sCharacter('new_brz_monarch_scope').GetFirstNameNoFormatting] would have a near impossible task ahead: to fill the shoes of Dom Pedro II the Magnanimous."
  pedro.7.a: "The Emperor is dead. Long live the [SCOPE.sCharacter('new_brz_monarch_scope').GetPrimaryRoleTitle]."
  pedro.8.t: "The Proclamation of the Republic"
  pedro.8.d: "In a bloodless coup, the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('armed_forces_ig').GetName] and [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('landowners_ig').GetName] have overthrown the [GetLawType('law_monarchy').GetName] of [SCOPE.sCharacter('pedro_scope').GetFullName] and proclaimed a [GetLawType('law_presidential_republic').GetName]. Though many wished to fight to defend the government and the [SCOPE.sCharacter('pedro_scope').GetPrimaryRoleTitle], the former monarch has urged peace and abdicated the throne."
  pedro.8.f: ""So that is that, is it?"\n\n"Yes, Pedro. You and your family are no longer in power. There's to be a republic. The new powers that be want you… removed to Europe, while they consolidate new power."\n\n"Very well. If it is so, it will be my retirement. I have worked too hard and I am tired. I will go rest then.""
  pedro.8.a: "I love the Republic."

  pedro.9.t: "The Republican Proposal"
  pedro.9.d: "In a private audience with [SCOPE.sCharacter('pedro_scope').GetFullName], Minister [SCOPE.sCharacter('republican_leader').GetFullName] has suggested that the [SCOPE.sCharacter('pedro_scope').GetPrimaryRoleTitle] could peacefully transition [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] to a republican form of government. The [SCOPE.sCharacter('pedro_scope').GetPrimaryRoleTitle] could be granted the honor of being the nation's first President after abdicating the throne."
  pedro.9.f: "The proposal was as intriguing as it was preposterous: dismantle the monarchy and replace it with a republic. Not any republic, but one with a head as powerful as a dictator. The constitution would be rewritten to accommodate the shift in power, but little would ultimately shift in Brazil's politics. Pedro would still be shackled to leadership, lest someone less competent took the reins."

  pedro.11.f: ""From today forth, I shall only be your president, until such a time as you, the people of Brazil, deem me unfit for my duties. I do not take lightly these duties put upon me, once entrusted as Emperor and now as President, for the responsibility is great indeed. But I ask you all: trust in me now as you did before.""

  pedro.12.f: ""This has been the most fatal blow I could have received, and I certainly would not have survived had it not been that I still have a wife and two children whom I need to educate so that they can guarantee the happiness of the country in which they were born.""

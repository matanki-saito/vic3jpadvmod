 ##### PORTUGUESE COLONIALISM #####

 # JE
 je_portuguese_colonialism: "Além-mar Africano"
 je_portuguese_colonialism_reason: "It would be a great embarrassment and injustice for our centuries-old empire to fall behind that of other powers.\n\nHaving already a foothold on the coasts of Africa, we are determined to seize the opportunity and extend the influence of our culture.\n\nOur first campaign aims to establish colonies at the southern ends of the strategic regions of [SCOPE.sStrategicRegion('congo_scope').GetName] and [SCOPE.sStrategicRegion('zanj_scope').GetName], so we might consider declaring them as our strategic interests if we haven't already. After that, we will focus on connecting the two coasts in the middle. Our colonial specialists are already working on mapping this area, but first, we should make an impact on the region with our newly founded colonies."

 je_the_pink_map: "The Pink Map"
 je_the_pink_map_reason: "With multiple colonies successfully established on east and west coasts of Africa, we can take the opportunity to connect them with a corridor in the belly of the continent.\n\nWe have developed a proposal called #bold The Pink Map#!, which outlines our goals for which areas to colonize. Accomplishing such a goal will evolve us into an unmatchable power in the colonial race."

 # Decisions
 # The Pink Map
 pink_map: "Propose the Pink Map"
 pink_map_desc: "Send a delegation of diplomats to Britain to negotiate our ambitions for the Pink Map.

 pink_map_tt2:1 "Should we decide to pursue this endeavor, our diplomats will prepare a presentation and travel to #bold Britain#! to solicit their approval. They may simply grant their approval, request a reciprocal favor, or deny our proposal. We will retain the option to proceed with the campaign regardless of their response."

 # Goa
 goa_decision: "Incorporate Goa"
 goa_decision_desc: "Having enough reasons to be considered a real Portuguese state, Goa deserves an official declaration of incorporation."

 # Macao
 macao_decision: "Invest in Macao"
 macao_decision_desc: "The treaty port of Macao has great potential, and is increasingly crucial to our trade network. We should consider an investment plan to capitalize on its development."

 # Events
 #1 Initiation
 portuguese_colonialism.1.t: "Coastal Strongholds"
 portuguese_colonialism.1.d: "Successfully colonizing [SCOPE.sState('colony_state_scope').GetName] has reignited centuries of expertise and ambition. The government sees building strong foundations along the African coasts as an excellent opportunity."
 portuguese_colonialism.1.f: "It had been nearly a month since Fr. Duarte left. The trip was fairly smooth, though the days went by quicker than he expected as he worked to organize various records about pagan religious sites, rock art, and megaliths with ritual carvings.\n\nHe couldn't wait to show his documents to his fellow brothers and start planning the work schedule for potential missionaries heading to the new colony."
 portuguese_colonialism.1.a: "Yes, this is the course of action we should undertake."
 portuguese_colonialism.1.b: "We have other issues that require our attention."
 portuguese_colonialism.1.b_tt: "Removes #bold Além-mar Africano#! from the Journal of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]."

 #2 Complete
 portuguese_colonialism.2.t: "Mirrored Triumph"
 portuguese_colonialism.2.d: "We have established several colonies along the eastern and western coasts of Africa, and several exploration missions are currently being organized to explore the central region."
 portuguese_colonialism.2.f: ""Why do we have dozens more compared to yesterday?"\n\n"A whole new tribe, sir. They were discovered behind the steep ravine to the west by the field patrol, near hand-carved caves."\n\n"Odd... I want them presented in front of my tent this afternoon. Include the elders.""
 portuguese_colonialism.2.a: "We must rapidly populate these colonies."
 portuguese_colonialism.2.b: "Let our objectors know that the old [SCOPE.sCountry('por_scope').GetName] is back."
 portuguese_colonialism.2.c: "The whole world shall realize our greatness."
 portuguese_colonialism.2.the_pink_map_tt:1 "The #b $pink_map$#! [concept_decision] is now available"

 #3 Fail
 portuguese_colonialism.3.t: "A Fruitless Establishment"
 portuguese_colonialism.3.d: "Our attempts to colonize the African coastlines have ended with an unfortunate blunder. We have failed to establish or hold a single colony around the landmass we initially aimed for."
 portuguese_colonialism.3.f: ""N'wananga, the hounds have gone, at last. Chased by lions, they ran without turning back."\n\nShe raised a hand to shade her eyes, squinting eyes to face her husband, said:\n\n"And will they ever return, Mwanapwesi?"\n\n"As this earth is the witness of their cowardice, and these trees of their greed, my sons—our sons—will show them the strength of the pride, if they ever try.""
 portuguese_colonialism.3.a: "Most unfortunate."
 portuguese_colonialism.3.b: "We have misjudged our capabilities"

 #4 Pink Map GBR: A stance has to be made
 portuguese_colonialism.4.t: "The Pink Map"
 portuguese_colonialism.4.d: "Suspicious of our potential ambitions in southern Africa, emissaries from [SCOPE.sCountry('por_scope').GetName] have arrived to seek accord regarding a document called "The Pink Map." They aim to connect their coastal colonies of [GetStateRegion('STATE_SOUTH_ANGOLA').GetName] and [GetStateRegion('STATE_MOCAMBIQUE').GetName] with an inland corridor."
 portuguese_colonialism.4.f: ""And you will deliver this... to Lord Salisbury himself?"\n\n"Absolutely, sir. Should the [SCOPE.sCountry('gbr_scope').GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] dispute, I will remind them that we bring not only trade but civilization and the preservation of history to those lands."\n\n"They only listen to gunboats and gold, Pereira, trust me.""
 portuguese_colonialism.4.a: "This is of no harm to us."
 portuguese_colonialism.4.a_tt: "[SCOPE.sCountry('por_scope').GetName] will receive our blessing of #bold The Pink Map#!."
 portuguese_colonialism.4.b: "We may do so, with a caveat."
 portuguese_colonialism.4.b_tt: "[SCOPE.sCountry('por_scope').GetName] will receive an event about our demand, and upon accepting, they will owe us an [concept_obligation]. They might also choose to back down, or ignore our demand."
 portuguese_colonialism.4.c: "This is an unacceptable request."
 portuguese_colonialism.4.c_tt: "[SCOPE.sCountry('por_scope').GetName] will receive an event regarding our refusal. They may still choose to proceed, damaging our [concept_relations]."

 might_get_additional_rewards_tt: "[SCOPE.sCountry('por_scope').GetName] may send an additional token of their appreciation, granting us increased [concept_prestige] and [concept_relations] with #v $POR$#!"

 #5 Pink Map POR: GBR Accepted, Pink Map JE starts
 portuguese_colonialism.5.t: "[SCOPE.sCountry('gbr_scope').GetName] Recognizes the Pink Map"
 portuguese_colonialism.5.d: "[SCOPE.sCountry('gbr_scope').GetName] has given us their blessing for The Pink Map campaign. We shall begin the preparations."
 portuguese_colonialism.5.f: "Pereira adjusted his attire one last time before entering Visconde Duarte's room. He knew the news of his success had spread faster than he could arrive in these halls, but he was still excited to share his achievement, expecting the proud look of a father towards a son.\n\nAnd that is precisely what happened. Duarte was thrilled that his pupil finally experienced a diplomatic triumph after years of performing simple tasks."
 portuguese_colonialism.5.a: "They have our gratitude."
 portuguese_colonialism.5.b: "Dispatch something of value in return for their good will."
 portuguese_colonialism.5.b_tt: "An exquisite work of art will be commisioned and sent to [SCOPE.sCountry('gbr_scope').GetName] as a gift. They will receive a boost to their [concept_prestige] and increase [concept_relations] with us by #bold 30#!."

 #6 Pink Map POR: GBR Rejected, what is our response?
 portuguese_colonialism.6.t: "[SCOPE.sCountry('gbr_scope').GetName] Rejects the Pink Map"
 portuguese_colonialism.6.d: "[SCOPE.sCountry('gbr_scope').GetName] has refused to give us their blessing for The Pink Map campaign. What will be our response?"
 portuguese_colonialism.6.f: "The proprietor of the gazette press waited anxiously, remaining still at the scheduled time of the officer and his personnel's arrival.\n\nAfter issuing the warning, he realized that describing the events in Britain as a "failure" in tomorrow's paper could cause trouble. Still, he was prepared to counter the profiteers' attempts at using his position of power."
 portuguese_colonialism.6.a: "We should not poke the beast."
 portuguese_colonialism.6.a_tt: "This will forever disallow us to add #bold The Pink Map#! entry to our [concept_journal_entry]."
 portuguese_colonialism.6.b: "Well, at least we tried."
 portuguese_colonialism.6.b_tt: "[SCOPE.sCountry('gbr_scope').GetName]'s aggressiveness towards us will increase."

 #7 Pink Map GBR: POR pursues no matter what
 #portuguese_colonialism.7.f: "With the arrival of the last participant, the meeting began without delay.\n\nThis was the third day of consecutive negotiations to divide the riches of a foreign country's colonial holdings in Africa. The rose-colored map was rolled out on the table.\n\nAfter hours of discussion, except for a few, everyone was pleased with the piece of pie they were promised: stretches of land, precise locations of untouched reserves, and most importantly, capable men who would #italic voluntarily#! carry the load to the ships. And of course, bribing the local authorities was the easiest part of the plan."

 #8 Pink Map JE Complete
 portuguese_colonialism.8.t: "A Dream Fulfilled"
 portuguese_colonialism.8.d: "The Pink Map is now a reality. We have reminded the world of the might of [SCOPE.sCountry('por_scope').GetName]."
 portuguese_colonialism.8.f: "“It was Portugal, small among the nations of Europe, that first brought to the world the idea of a universal civilization, connecting peoples and continents through commerce, the Christian faith, and scientific curiosity. Not with the destroying sword, but with the cross, the language, and ingenuity, the Portuguese opened routes across unknown seas, revealed unknown peoples, and extended European influence to the farthest reaches of the globe.”\n\n— Oliveira Martins, #italic História da Civilização Ibérica, Chapter X#!"
 portuguese_colonialism.8.a: "[SCOPE.sCountry('por_scope').GetName], a Nação dos Heróis!"
 portuguese_colonialism.8.b: "I am the supreme [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] of Africa!"

 #9 Pink Map JE Failed
 portuguese_colonialism.9.t: "The Pink Map, Refuted"
 portuguese_colonialism.9.d: "Though the Pink Map initiative has long been a national dream, we have overestimated our ability to make it a reality."
 portuguese_colonialism.9.f: "The lone colonial officer stood beneath the burning African sun before his hut, clutching a crumpled copy of a torn Pink Map.\n\nBehind him, the [SCOPE.sCountry('por_scope').GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] flag had been lowered from a makeshift wooden pole, with native porters looking on silently, some with hidden smiles, others with contempt.\n\nThe vision of a vast Lusophone Africa, stretching unbroken from coast to coast, crumbles like the brittle paper in his grip."
 portuguese_colonialism.9.a: "How did we fail this?"
 portuguese_colonialism.9.b: "It was the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('armed_forces_scope').GetName]' incompetence."

 #10 Pink Map POR: GBR Accepted, but wants a favor
 portuguese_colonialism.10.t: "[SCOPE.sCountry('gbr_scope').GetName]'s Demand"
 portuguese_colonialism.10.d: "[SCOPE.sCountry('gbr_scope').GetName] has requested concessions in return for their approval of the Pink Map campaign."
 portuguese_colonialism.10.f: ""Your Excellency, they are unlikely to oppose our Pink Map claims if we offer some concessions. As they say, [SCOPE.sCountry('por_scope').GetNameNoFormatting] can draw the map, but the [SCOPE.sCountry('gbr_scope').GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] controls the brush. Saying no could lead to isolation; agreeing ensures their support but will render us weak in the eyes of our subjects.\n\nWe await your verdict.""
 portuguese_colonialism.10.a: "Let them have their way, this time."
 portuguese_colonialism.10.a_tt: "[SCOPE.sCountry('gbr_scope').GetName] drafts #bold The Pink Map [concept_treaty]#! with [SCOPE.sCountry('por_scope').GetName], obligating [SCOPE.sCountry('por_scope').GetName] to pay a tribute of @money! #bold 200#! per month for #bold 24 months#!."
 portuguese_colonialism.10.b: "This is starting to feel like a pointless aspiration."
 portuguese_colonialism.10.c: "What are they even thinking?"

 #11 Pink Map GBR: POR sends gift for our acceptance
 #portuguese_colonialism.11.f: ""With deep expertise in drawing techniques and a constant emphasis on the 'balance of proportion and line,' he saw himself more as a draftsman than a painter. He was also a talented portrait artist.\n\n#italic João António Correia#! considered drawing essential for training any artist, no matter their field. His critical, demanding, yet open-minded approach allowed his students to cultivate their unique talents. This earned him an important teaching role that profoundly impacted his peers and future artists."\n\n— #italic Inscribed on the museum label beneath the gifted artwork#!"

 #12 Pink Map GBR: POR decides not to pursue the Pink Map
 #portuguese_colonialism.12.f: "Drums thundered through Kazembe’s royal court as Mwata Kazembe rose, wielding his shining axe. Warriors stomped with shields clashing in a steady rhythm, while women cried ululations, their voices cutting through the midday heat.\n\nThe king performed the Mutomboko dance, his feet pounding the dust as he symbolized ancient victories. Elders recounted migration stories, children played and laughed, and smoke rose from distant feasts. The nearby river sang softly, and everyone understood: today, they celebrated victory, heritage, and the resilient spirit of the Lunda."

 #13 Pink Map GBR: POR accepts to give us the favor
 #portuguese_colonialism.13.f: "The administrator gazed upon the piece of paper on the lectern before facing the crowd.\n\n"Of course — the proud [SCOPE.sCountry('por_scope').GetAdjectiveNoFormatting], a once-mighty navigator, crawled to us, asking for our approval, chasing their fantasies of empire across the belly of Africa. Huh! Let them march, I say! Let them sweat beneath the sun! For every mile they take, they do so not as masters, but as subjects who have paid for the privilege, for no flag flies without our approval!"\n\nThe crowd went ecstatic.

 #14 Pink Map GBR: POR ignores our favor demand, pursues the Pink Map anyways
 #portuguese_colonialism.14.f: ""Do you see this, Garrett?"\n\n"Good heavens—what on earth is that #italic thing#!?"\n\n"This? A region in Africa that [SCOPE.sCountry('por_scope').GetNameNoFormatting] claim as theirs. Quite absurd, really. And listen to this—our very own [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] asked for a toll to approve it, and the [SCOPE.sCountry('por_scope').GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] weren't amused.\n\n"No, you dolt, I am asking about that contraption at the bottom, with smoke billowing above it! #italic What is that#!?""

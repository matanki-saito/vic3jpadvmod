 acw_events.1.t:0 "The Abolitionist's Martyrdom"
 acw_events.1.d:0 "An ardent abolitionist writer died in a firefight against a pro-slavery mob which had gathered in front of his house. The story has gone national, and radicalized previously apathetic individuals high and low."
 acw_events.1.f:0 "His friend sighed. The funeral had been small, lest the mob appear again in force. The gravestone itself was simple, not calling attention to itself. The only embellishment that had been allowed was a simple inscription:\n\n"Here lies a brave man: now spare his grave.""
 acw_events.1.a:0 "Ghastly! The violence of slavers must be resisted."
 acw_events.1.b:0 "This abolitionist agitation must be stopped!"

[SCOPE.sCharacter('slaver_ig_leader').GetLastName] has demanded his return, but abolitionists are calling for [SCOPE.sCharacter('slaver_ig_leader').GetHerHis] demands to be ignored."
 acw_events.2.f:1 ""There are few things that I care more about than justice. If a man loses his jacket, it's only natural that it would be returned to him, right? I simply ask that what's mine be returned to me. Why is this causing such an uproar?""

 acw_events.3.d:0 "[SCOPE.sCharacter('wilmot_proviso_ig_leader').GetFullName], leader of the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('wilmot_proviso_ig').GetName], has proposed outright prohibiting slavery in all our new western territories. Some opponents demand simple moderation, but others are demanding legalization of slavery in all new territories."
 acw_events.3.f:0 ""This intolerable institution cannot spread its influence any further! A free nation needs free soil if it is to thrive!""
 acw_events.3.a:0 "Reject the proviso, this remains a state-by-state issue."

 acw_events.6.f:0 ""Such barbarism! I sadly do not see how two such disparate communities can still constitute one state.""
 acw_events.6.a:0 "[SCOPE.sCharacter('preston_brooks_leader').GetFullName] was just defending his honor. We will do nothing."

 acw_events.8.f:0 "The wisps of smoke grew more and more feeble with each huff of their tired locomotive, the [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('random_csa_acw_locomotive')]. The raiders had run out of fuel miles back, and the rails they had torn up hadn't been enough to save them. In the distance, plumes of smoke from their pursuers grew ever-closer. The chase was coming to an end."
 acw_events.8.a:0 "Damn everything else, rebuild those tracks and lines now!"
 acw_events.8.b:0 "Keeping troops on our trains will slow them down, but make them safer."

 acw_followup_events.6.f:0 ""Draw a line one side of which you see intelligence, virtue, self-respect, and democracy; and on the other the absolute unchecked political supremacy of brute force and terror, and there you will behold not one attribute of free government, but the saddest tyranny of the Old South desperately clawing back power that ever cursed this earth."" # this is an inversion of Lucius Quintus Cincinnatus Lamar II's horrible racist diatribe.

labour_associations_events.1.t: "Union Free"
labour_associations_events.1.d: "Threatened by the strengthening of workers' associations under [SCOPE.sLaw('current_law_scope').GetName], the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('industrialists_ig').GetName] have publicized numerous reports on the dangers of a unionized workforce."

labour_associations_events.1.a: "They must be terrified."

labour_associations_events.2.t: "Preemptive Strikes"
labour_associations_events.2.d: "The news of the government's efforts to enshrine the [SCOPE.sLaw('current_law_scope').GetName] has spread rapidly through working-class communities. The [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('industrialists_ig').GetName] have begun to complain of a corresponding uptick in illegal union activity."
labour_associations_events.2.f: "The moment the government announced its initiative, the posters started appearing. The vain efforts of the night-watchmen to catch the perpetrators bore no fruit, forcing the firm into damage-control. Every night, the walls were plastered - and in the morning, the company filled the bins with the last night's efforts.\n\nThe very next week, the garbagemen announced their new union."
labour_associations_events.2.a: "Order the courts to disregard these complaints."
labour_associations_events.2.b: "The present laws remain in effect."

labour_associations_events.3.t: "The Commission on Trade Unions"
labour_associations_events.3.d: "Following petitions from labor groups, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('country_legislature_name')] has assembled a commission on [SCOPE.sLaw('current_law_scope').GetName]. The commission has delivered two reports to the government - a majority report written by the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('opposed_ig').GetName], and a minority report sympathetic to the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('unions_ig').GetName]."
labour_associations_events.3.f: ""In fact, the law as it stood is one-sided and unjust. For while nearly every combination of workmen in furtherance of their objects was held to be a conspiracy in restraint of trade, and therefore criminally punishable, precisely similar acts committed by a master escaped the notice of the law, as not involving the offence of conspiracy. But, in fact, the employer of some thousands of workmen was, in himself, a combination."" #- Henry Bruce, on the 1871 Trade Unions Act
labour_associations_events.3.a: "Adopt the minority report."
labour_associations_events.3.b: "The majority report is more convincing."

labour_associations_events.4.t: "A Dying Industry"
labour_associations_events.4.d: "The government's attacks on the [GetLawType('law_guild_system').GetName] have spurred riots amongst those who feel their livelihood is under threat. In [SCOPE.sState('relevant_state').GetName], rioting artisans and skilled laborers have smashed machinery and intimidated contractors."
labour_associations_events.4.f: "A curse on the God to whom our petition\nWe vainly address'd when in starving condition;\nIn vain did we hope, and in vain did we wait,\nHe only derided and mock'd our sad fate,—\nWe're weaving, we're weaving!" #- Die armen Weber, Heinrich Heine
labour_associations_events.4.a: "If they cannot compete freely, they may find a job elsewhere."
labour_associations_events.4.b: "Send in the Army to protect property."

labour_associations_events.5.t: "The Last Ditch"
labour_associations_events.5.d: "The efforts of the government to enact [SCOPE.sLaw('current_law_scope').GetName] has been met with near-universal opposition from the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('trade_unions_ig').GetName]. Union leadership has called a general strike in a bid to make the government concede."
labour_associations_events.5.f: "The unions were out in force. Every light pole within a mile of [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('country_legislature_name')] was draped in red streamers, and foot traffic was a hopeless endeavor. Several government legislators had elected to sleep in their offices rather than brave the human tides. Others, the radicals in the opposition, had elected to join it. They had found their way back cut off by a line of policemen which snaked all the way around the building.\n\nBoth sides now saw it as a state of siege. The protestors had worked out a truly impressive logistics system to distribute bread and water amongst themselves, whilst the legislators tapped [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('country_legislature_name')]'s cafeteria and wine cellar.\n\n"How long?" asked a junior member. His colleague could no longer muster the energy to answer."
labour_associations_events.5.a: "Their reaction justifies the bill."
labour_associations_events.5.b: "Offer to negotiate."
labour_associations_events.5.c: "Intercept their means of communication."

labour_associations_events.6.t: "Intolerable Strife"
labour_associations_events.6.d: "A book detailing the horrific conditions that industrial laborers are routinely subjected to has become an overnight success. The success of the book has raised public interest in [SCOPE.sLaw('current_law_scope').GetName], whilst embarrassing the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('industrialists_ig').GetName]."
labour_associations_events.6.f: ""Thus the social order makes family life almost impossible for the worker. In a comfortless, filthy house, hardly good enough for mere nightly shelter, ill-furnished, often neither rain-tight nor warm, a foul atmosphere filling rooms overcrowded with human beings, no domestic comfort is possible. The husband works the whole day through, perhaps the wife also and the elder children, all in different places; they meet night and morning only, all under perpetual temptation to drink; what family life is possible under such conditions?"" #- Friedrich Engels, The Condition of the Working Class in England
labour_associations_events.6.a: "The workers should be able to advocate for themselves."
labour_associations_events.6.b: "We must not further upset the owners."

labour_associations_events.7.t: "The Letter of the Law"
labour_associations_events.7.d: "Emboldened by the government's turn against organized labor, the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('relevant_bourgeois_ig').GetName] have begun to preemptively crack down on labor unions within their shops. The [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('unions_ig').GetName] demand a response whilst the old laws still stand."
labour_associations_events.7.f: "It was an absurdity. The clerk knew it, his superiors knew it, and the union representative standing before him probably knew it as well. A last-minute petition relying upon a law which would vanish from the books before it could ever reach a judge.\n\nAnd yet, it was perfect. It lacked any obvious error that would permit him to reject it out-of-hand. His only option was to let it clog someone else's inbox. The corners of his mouth tightened into a joyless smile.\n\n"Thank you, sir. The Ministry will contact you by mail.""
labour_associations_events.7.a: "They no longer possess any standing."
labour_associations_events.7.b: "We must uphold the existing legislation."

labour_associations_events.8.t: "The Free Market of Labor"
labour_associations_events.8.d: "As the government takes steps to dismantle the [GetLawType('law_guild_system').GetName], emboldened [GetPopType('laborers').GetName] and [GetPopType('machinists').GetName] have begun to break into fields they were formerly excluded from."
labour_associations_events.8.f: ""I'm off. I meant to say earlier. I've found a job in [SCOPE.sState('relevant_state').GetCityHubName], at the factory. They've offered me a loan for transport, a bunk..."\n\nHe trailed off, looking at the face of his friends in turn.\n\n"Thank you. For everything. I'll write, or I'll ask someone to. It's been... it's been wonderful. I'll see you again, someday. I promise.""
labour_associations_events.8.a: "Our efforts are well-rewarded."
labour_associations_events.8.b: "A great victory for liberty."

labour_associations_events.9.t: "Ulterior Motives"
labour_associations_events.9.d: "Sensing a chance to disadvantage their economic rivals in the cities, prominent members of the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('landowners_ig').GetName] have come out in favor of enacting [SCOPE.sLaw('current_law_scope').GetName]."
labour_associations_events.9.f: ""The unions are agents of disorder - but, crucially, agents which reserve their greatest hostility for our immediate competitors. They will demand concessions from their superiors, concessions which carve deeply into the pockets of [SCOPE.sState('relevant_state').GetCityHubName]'s magnates. To compensate for these losses, they shall be forced to raise their prices, placing our own produce in a deeply favorable position."\n\n"And what of our own populace? Need we fear a Union of Peasants?"\n\n"They may breathe clean air and feel the sun on their necks. Many hold their own plots. What need have they for a union?""
labour_associations_events.9.a: "A perfectly workable arrangement."
labour_associations_events.9.b: "We must be wary of offers like these."

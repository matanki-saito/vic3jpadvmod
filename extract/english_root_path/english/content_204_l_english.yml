  krakow.1.t: "The Manifesto for the Polish Nation"
  krakow.1.d: "As revolution breaks out in the free city of [SCOPE.sCountry('krakow_scope').GetName], radical Polish nationalist figures have issued a manifesto calling for universal suffrage, the abolition of serfdom, and the reunification of Poland."
  krakow.1.f: "Poles!\n\nThe hour of the uprising has struck - the whole of Poland is rising and growing together - our brothers in the Duchy of Poznań, in Congress Poland, in Lithuania, and in Ruthenia have already risen, and are fighting the enemy.\n\nFrom now on, we do not know any difference between us. We are now brothers, sons of one Motherland, with one father, God in heaven! Let us call upon Him for help, and He will bless our weapons and give us victory!"
  krakow.1.a: "We must reassert control over Kraków immediately."
  krakow.1.b: "We are bound to preserve the status of the Treaty of Vienna."

  krakow.2.t: "The Grand Duchy of Kraków"
  krakow.2.d: "With the revolution in Kraków crushed, the former Free City has been integrated into the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria as the Grand Duchy of Kraków. This act has spurred controversy in Europe for violating the Treaty of Vienna."

  je_the_red_scare: "The Red Scare"
  je_the_red_scare_reason: "The emergence of a powerful communist regime in a foreign country has aroused fears amongst certain segments of the population that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] will be the next to fall to communism.\n\nDomestic political currents with left-wing agendas have fallen under the scrutiny of anti-communist forces, as they are accused of being harbingers of bloody revolution, and agents of foreign powers."
  red_scare_unlock_tt: "Any [concept_country] with a [concept_rank] above #variable Minor Power#! that we have an [concept_interest] in has enacted the [GetLawType('law_council_republic').GetName] [concept_law]"

  red_scare.1.t: "The Red Scare"
  red_scare.1.d: "The rise of the communist regime in [SCOPE.sCountry('red_scare_target_nation').GetName] has spurred a sense of terror and mistrust across [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] society. Many fear that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetNameNoFormatting] will be the next to fall to communism."
  red_scare.1.f: "Every newspaper on the stand bore a title more extreme than the last. Shrill newsboys hawked them on corners, sending competing claims of atrocity and terror across streets.\n\n"Assassins and madmen claim power in [SCOPE.sCountry('red_scare_target_nation').GetNameNoFormatting]!" cried one of them. "Recovered "Red Bible" reveals agenda of world revolutionists!" shouts another. And amidst all of them marched ten thousand wide-opened ears, soaking up each sensational word as they hurried along to their stations."
  red_scare.1.a: "It could happen here!"
  red_scare.1.b: "A panic would be wholly unwarranted."

  red_scare.2.t: "The Nationalization of Women"
  red_scare.2.d: "Following government hearings into the activities of the communist regime in [SCOPE.sCountry('red_scare_target_nation').GetName], newspapers across [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] have reported sensational stories about all adult women in [SCOPE.sCountry('red_scare_target_nation').GetName] being nationalized as common property."
  red_scare.2.f: ""I saw it myself, before I fled. The Red authorities have mandated collective orgies, within which there is no respect for virtuous women. All women are forced to participate - the Ministry of Free Love registers every one of them, under threat of the bayonet."\n\n"And you claim that, and I quote, "a girl, having reached her eighteenth year, is to become state property at once"?"\n\n"Yes, yes. Their names are placed on a bulletin board in their towns, and all eligible men are permitted to marry them at will, as many as they wish...""
  red_scare.2.a: "The Communists are coming for our women!"
  red_scare.2.b: "This testimony seems highly suspect."

  red_scare.3.t: "Communist Criminality"
  red_scare.3.d: "Rumors about the atrocities of communists in [SCOPE.sCountry('red_scare_target_nation').GetName] have reached the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] press, with reports about crimes against humanity and stacked corpses filling the front pages of newspapers."
  red_scare.3.f: ""Did you hear of the bombings the other day? This time it was a lawyer. One of the big ones advising the government."\n\n"Another one? Heavens, that's the third this month. This is supposed to be a safe country."\n\n"Safe? Bah, not with these Communist rats running around. They'll kill us all if we don't kneel down first.""
  red_scare.3.a: "Who knew that people could be so barbaric?"
  red_scare.3.b: "They had ought to publish something else, for once."

  red_scare.4.t: "Red Revolution; Yellow Headlines"
  red_scare.4.d: "Newspapers sympathetic to the interests of the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('anticommunist_press_ig').GetName] have printed numerous stories about the revolutionary desires of communists in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. The articles paint lurid pictures of strikes and planned terrorism."
  red_scare.4.f: "#bold The Red Plague Festers#! \n\nCorrespondents from across the world have reported the unnatural stirrings of a thought most foul: that man no longer be entitled to the sweat of his brow. That many hard working [SCOPE.sCountry('red_scare_target_nation').GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] citizens no longer have natural rights to his property. And that his privacy be no more than a fleeting desire.\n\nThis thought is Communism, and it is coming for everyone in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetNameNoFormatting]."
  red_scare.4.a: "We must get this situation under control!"
  red_scare.4.b: "We cannot have a panic on our hands."

  red_scare.5.t: "Dangerous Hours"
  red_scare.5.d: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('anticommunist_person').GetFullName], a particularly prominent figure within the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('anticommunist_ig').GetName], has issued scathing accusations of communist infiltration within the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] press and government itself."
  red_scare.5.f: ""What do you propose we do? We're losing the people. I'm sure I don't need to dictate their sentiments to you."\n\n"No... no, you don't. My kingdom for a worthy distraction from the ills of our government. Preferably one more credibly bloodthirsty than ours."\n\n"By Jove, that's it! What was the name of that dreadful ideology? Whichever it is, summon the papers at once!""
  red_scare.5.a: "Call those accused before an investigatory committee."
  red_scare.5.b: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('anticommunist_person').GetSheHe|U] should provide some evidence for these claims."

  red_scare.6.t: "Nativist Discontent"
  red_scare.6.d: "Nativists within the ranks of the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('nativist_ig').GetName] have issued statements declaring [SCOPE.sCulture('council_republic_culture').GetName] people in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] to be communist infiltrators. This rhetoric has already led to crimes against [SCOPE.sCulture('council_republic_culture').GetName] people."
  red_scare.6.f: "They were innocent. All six of them were acquitted. Or, at least half of them were before they heard cries of a mistrial. Now a miscarriage of justice by vigilante hands would kill them here. If they weren't shot in their cells, they were dragged out by the neck and hung before being shot. Executed for the crime of being [SCOPE.sCulture('council_republic_culture').GetNameNoFormatting] by birth. And the country would thank the crowd for it."
  red_scare.6.a: "What is there to be done about it?"
  red_scare.6.b: "Halt this behavior before it spreads."

  red_scare.7.t: "Red-Baiting"
  red_scare.7.d: "Riding the wave of the Red Scare, a new and fiercely reactionary political movement under the ardently anti-communist [SCOPE.sCharacter('fascist_agitator').GetFullName] has coalesced in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], calling for relentless opposition to the depradations of communists both abroad and at home."
  red_scare.7.f: "The crashing of the drums was a new feature of the weekends. The jeering shouts and shows of force in the streets were growing louder and larger by the month. At its head was a rising star of some political faction too small to garner much attention. But [SCOPE.sCharacter('fascist_agitator').GetSheHe] garnered swift attention from an outrage-addicted media."
  red_scare.7.a: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('fascist_agitator').GetFullName] is a true [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] patriot!"
  red_scare.7.b: "This rhetoric seems to be just as extremist."

  red_scare.8.t: "Marching Against Peace"
  red_scare.8.d: "Protesters inspired by the fierce rhetoric of [SCOPE.sCharacter('anticommunist_leader').GetFullName] have carried out a march in [SCOPE.sState('capital_scope').GetCityHubName], calling for military intervention against the communist regime in [SCOPE.sCountry('red_scare_target_nation').GetName]."
  red_scare.8.f: "What began as a few-dozen shouting men in the streets swelled to a corpus numbering the thousands. What began as a peaceful demonstration grew to chants of fire and fury, all baying for blood. What began as a show of fear transformed into a call for action.\n\nTheir demands were simple: tear out the [SCOPE.sCountry('red_scare_target_nation').GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] menace, no matter the cost."
  red_scare.8.a: "We must save the [SCOPE.sCountry('red_scare_target_nation').GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] people from themselves."
  red_scare.8.b: "The people's energies are best spent on something more constructive."

  red_scare.9.t: "In the Face of Revolution"
  red_scare.9.d: "Policemen chasing rumors of an allegedly planned communist uprising in [SCOPE.sState('communist_uprising_state').GetName] have stirred significant fear amongst the area's public. Local skeptics decry the disturbance as terrorism in itself."
  red_scare.9.f: ""Not sure I understand, superintendent. You want us to go to this block in the dead of night, while everyone's asleep, to raid this warehouse on #italic suspicion#! that it #italic might#! be a communist meeting place?" \n\n"That is exactly what I want you to do, sergeant. Now, might I count on you to carry out this task, or shall I volunteer some men for you?"
  red_scare.9.a: "If it doesn't materialize, then we'll have done our jobs."
  red_scare.9.b: "There is no reason to believe this is credible."

  red_scare.10.t: "The White Émigrés"
  red_scare.10.d: "A stream of wealthy [SCOPE.sCulture('council_republic_culture').GetName] émigrés fleeing the communist regime in [SCOPE.sCountry('red_scare_target_nation').GetName] have sought shelter in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], bringing with them tales of revolutionary terror and unbridled proletarian excess."
  red_scare.10.f: ""The worst was these new secret police, just like the old ones. They would round up people they didn't like, usually when all was dark and quiet. Sometimes the day too. And if we ever saw liquor trucks going to their offices... well, we never saw our neighbors again. We had to get out."\n\n"Very brave. We'll take good care of you here. Anything for [SCOPE.sCountry('red_scare_target_nation').GetNameNoFormatting]'s most upstanding citizens.""
  red_scare.10.a: "Give them a platform to tell their stories."
  red_scare.10.b: "A tragic procession."

  red_scare.11.t: "Progressive Dilemmas"
  red_scare.11.d: "The backlash against the policies of the [SCOPE.sCountry('red_scare_target_nation').GetAdjective] communists has led to mounting pressure on the progressive leaders of the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('progressive_ig').GetName] to explicitly denounce the government of [SCOPE.sCountry('red_scare_target_nation').GetName]."
  red_scare.11.f: "They loomed over him, at least a half-dozen and all built to lift cisterns. At first, it was a courtesy call to the watering hole. Some boy fresh off the fields recognized him over a pint. Then the barmaid remembered his praise about [SCOPE.sCountry('red_scare_target_nation').GetNameNoFormatting]'s government. Now, it was a sizable crowd with six strongmen at the helm.\n\n"Well... the thing with [SCOPE.sCountry('red_scare_target_nation').GetNameNoFormatting] is...""
  red_scare.11.a: "For the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('progressive_ig').GetLeader.GetIdeology.GetName] cause, not the [SCOPE.sCountry('red_scare_target_nation').GetAdjective] one!"
  red_scare.11.b: "This road leads to nothing but more extorted concessions."
  red_scare.11.c: "The socialist cause in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] is hopeless."

  red_scare.12.t: "Anarchists on Trial"
  red_scare.12.d: "A particularly bloody armed robbery in [SCOPE.sState('red_scare_victim_state').GetName] has led to the arrests and convictions of two [SCOPE.sCulture('sacco_and_vanzetti_culture').GetName] men known to be anarchists. The evidence against the men is tenuous, and the judge has been accused of both racial and ideological prejudice."
  red_scare.12.f: "Spent bullet casings at a robbery: that was what law enforcement determined was the culpable link. Finding anarchist literature was the cream on top of the mash. Anyone would have done, but these [SCOPE.sCulture('sacco_and_vanzetti_culture').GetNameNoFormatting] men were a convenient bow tie. It wouldn't take long for a jury to convict them."
  red_scare.12.a: "Murderers deserve a taste of their own medicine."
  red_scare.12.b: "A lengthy prison sentence will suffice."

  red_scare.13.t: "Facing the Chair"
  red_scare.13.d: "As the execution of two [SCOPE.sCulture('sacco_and_vanzetti_culture').GetName] anarchists convicted of murder draws near, protests from both skeptics of the conviction and [SCOPE.sCulture('sacco_and_vanzetti_culture').GetName] communities across the nation have sprung up in major cities."
  red_scare.13.f: "Cities from around the globe raised banners far and wide for the two convicted murderers. Even cities across [ROOT.GetCountry.GetNameNoFormatting] have risen to protest the ruling. Headlines and letters from every center of protest have one common thread: violence. Violence to meet violence. And more violence is all but certain if the executions are not stayed."
  red_scare.13.a: "Protests will not change what they did."
  red_scare.13.b: "Grant them a stay, and a retrial."

  red_scare.14.t: "The [SCOPE.sCountry('red_scare_target_nation').GetAdjective] Ark"
  red_scare.14.d: "With arrested communists beginning to stream into [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] prisons, figures within the government have suggested deporting the noncitizens among them to [SCOPE.sCountry('red_scare_target_nation').GetName] aboard a chartered cargo ship."
  red_scare.14.f: ""Just as the sailing of the Ark that Noah built was a pledge for the preservation of the human race, so the sailing of the [SCOPE.sCountry('red_scare_target_nation').GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] Ark is a pledge for the preservation of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetNameNoFormatting]."" #- NY Evening Journal

Their defenders have denounced the measure as inimical to democracy."
  red_scare.15.f: ""The five men before us have been elected on a platform that is absolutely inimical to the interests of both this body and that of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetNameNoFormatting]. They are supporters of revolutionary tyranny, foreign agents, and consorts of hostile nations. It is because of this that they have no right to stand in a position of power.

  red_scare.20.t: "A Subtler Terror"
  red_scare.20.d: "After years of competing propaganda and social mistrust, the Red Scare has ebbed to a more manageable level. Whilst many remain watchful for communist activity, the days of unmatched fear in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] have come to a relative end."
  red_scare.20.f: ""We have passed beyond the stage in political development when heresy-hunting is a permitted sport."" #- Charles Evans Hughes

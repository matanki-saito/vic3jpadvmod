  gg_core.1.d: "Through intrigue, deft diplomacy, and decisive warfare, we have brought the Great Game to a favorable conclusion. Our victory has brought [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] glory, and [SCOPE.sCountry('opponent_scope').GetName] humiliation on the world stage."
  gg_core.1.f: "Even the [SCOPE.sCountry('opponent_scope').GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] newspapers were saying it, now. The headlines that once spun even great setbacks into subtle victories and bouts of revanchism seemed subdued, solemnly reporting on foreign affairs as if [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] hegemony had been something that had always existed. The Ambassador looked at the spread of papers, and turned to a clerk who was barely repressing his own excitement.\n\n"Get me a copy for myself," he said, "I'd like to put that one on my wall.""
  gg_core.1.a: "A jewel in our crown to match none other."

  gg_core.2.f: ""We spent the past decades in a magnificent daydream, aimlessly blundering from one artless interference to another. With one hand we swiped at goals held just out of our reach, and with the other alienated those who were once receptive. The Great Game could never have been won - our early failings had crippled us long before we saw them for what they were, before we were even aware that we were playing.""
  gg_core.2.a: "Have our halcyon days passed?"

  gg_core.3.t: "Stalemate"
  gg_core.3.d: "Despite enormous expeditures in the battle for international influence, neither [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] nor [SCOPE.sCountry('opponent_scope').GetName] has achieved a decisive victory in the Great Game. Both sides have emerged from the conflict bruised and unable to best the other."
  gg_core.3.f: "Even before the Game was halfway through, there had been tell-alls published about it. Explorers' journals, musing about what they had seen in Bukhara or Kabul. No consensus had ever been reached, though there were periods where some ephemeral triumph had made it fashionable to proclaim a British or Russian advantage.\n\nOne was being reached now, however, and it was one that neither nation was proud of. The Great Game as a folly. From there, it would only be one short step towards a new game, one of finding a politician to blame."

By making that paper relentlessly and shamelessly endorse a certain viewpoint, one could have every working person in their city aware of it by evening. If one's competitors refused to stoop that low, they would become responsible for their own suffocation."

  movement_events.12.f: ""We do not wish to appear partisan." Always the same refrain. The organizer paced back and forth within his tiny office, fist clenched until it felt as if his knuckles were about to burst through his skin. Occasionally, he stole a glance at the unopened envelopes on his desk, all of which he knew would repeat a variation on the same.\n\n"Partisan" - what did that mean? That they cared for something? That they had chosen to do something beyond count the money in their vaults? He had something important to do, something which would improve society itself. They had a chance to do the same. In that light, how could partisanship possibly be bad?"

One that he would tell to the detective, and one that he would tell to his friends."
  movement_events.15.a: "Give them all a day in jail to cool off."

  gg_korea.2.f: "The orders had been circulated to everyone in the town. They were to drive to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetCityHubName] as quickly as they could, expel the foreigners, and kill every member of the [SCOPE.sCharacter('gov_leader_scope').GetLastNameNoFormatting] family.\n\nThis was to be a merciful march, sparing innocents and their property, paying for their supplies, and demonstrating their loyalty and piety to all who saw them.

  gg_korea.4.f: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] had become familiar with the followers of Donghak through reports of their organizing in the countryside and the innumerable small petitions and letters that had been sent to both [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerselfHimself] and [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] officials. All of them trended in the same way - statements of nothing but the utmost loyalty to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHim], followed by explanations of their requests.\n\nIt was not the first of its kind, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetSheHe] mused, but it was certainly the most high-profile.

Somewhere over the sea, some European merchant had surely entered a state of shock, and was sending letters to every government official that he knew. The Westerners would return - that was a certainty, and it was equally certain that they would return heavily armed.\n\nThere was something new about the people of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetPortHubName], though, a sort of invisible energy that followed them as they went about their day. They were no longer afraid of the ships and guns, and they no longer considered one another their greatest threat.

  gg_korea.6.f: "They had lost another messenger. Despite the hopes of his family, the inspector suspected that they would never see him again. Tax collectors, census-takers, messengers, policemen - all of them had begun to disappear in this region, if they strayed too far from the roads. It was never all of them, but it was enough - the atmosphere within the barracks had transitioned from cool indifference to terror, and that did not seem as if it would change.\n\nRather than a unified country, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetNameNoFormatting] had begun to seem like an archipelago of cities linked by the thinnest of webs, surrounded by a vast and terrible sea of contempt."
